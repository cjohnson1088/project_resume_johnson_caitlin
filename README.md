# Resources
* [Responsive Tabs Plugin](http://jellekralt.github.io/Responsive-Tabs/#tab-3)

I used this plugin for the main layout design of my resume page. Each tab features required content for each category.

* [Animated Skill Bars Plugin](http://www.jqueryscript.net/chart-graph/Animated-Configurable-Skill-Bar-Plugin-with-jQuery-Skills-Bar.html)

I used this plugin to create bars that show/animate a percentage of skill I have in different areas under my "skills" tab.

* [Backstretch Plugin](http://www.jquery-backstretch.com)

I used this simple plugin to make a responsive full-sized background image on my page.

* [Fade In Help](https://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/)

I used this link just to learn more about using the .fadeIn() because I wanted my picture to fade in when you click on the first tab in the stacked layout of the tabs.

* [Making my image go back to it's set value](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1091322/how-to-fade-to-display-inline-block)

I noticed when I set the image to fadeIn, my image was no longer centered so I researched how to make it go back to where I had originally wanted it to go on fadeIn.
